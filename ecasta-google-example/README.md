# ecasta-google-example

This is a simple cucumber and selenium example which opens the browser, calls google and searches for encoway. It's a good example for beginners who want to learn how cucumber and selenium works in JAVA.

It's also compatible to [ecasta](https://github.com/encoway/ecasta), so that you have just to build it with maven - **mvn install** - and put the jar into the _custom-jar_ lib. 

## Requirements
In this example the tests will be run by default in Chrome, so you need the Chrome Browser and also the [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). But you can change the driver and use which you want.
